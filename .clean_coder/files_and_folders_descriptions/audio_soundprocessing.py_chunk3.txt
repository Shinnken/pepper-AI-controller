The processRemote method is a callback function for audio processing that receives microphone input buffer and computes its Root Mean Square (RMS) power level. It converts the input buffer to signed integers, calculates the RMS level for the front microphone, and tracks processing progress by incrementing frame count. Once the specified number of frames is processed, it marks processing as complete.
