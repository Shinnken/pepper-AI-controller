This code chunk initializes a Naoqi application for sound processing on a NAO robot. It parses command-line arguments for IP and port, creates a connection to the Naoqi framework, and sets up a sound processing module as a registered service. The script then starts the sound processing by calling the startProcessing() method, which will begin capturing and analyzing audio from the robot's microphone.
