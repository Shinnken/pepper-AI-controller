The SoundReceiverModule is a NAOqi module designed to interact with the robot's audio device for capturing microphone input. It initializes an audio service connection, sets up client preferences for audio input (16kHz, single channel), and provides methods to start and stop audio input subscription. The module allows programmatic control of audio input by opening audio inputs, subscribing to the audio device, and tracking the processing state.
