This code imports essential libraries for image processing, machine learning object detection, and system interactions. It specifically includes OpenCV (cv2) for image manipulation, YOLO from Ultralytics for object detection, and standard Python libraries for file handling and JSON processing. The imports suggest preparation for a computer vision task involving object detection and image analysis.
