The SoundProcessingModule class is designed to capture and process audio signals from the front microphone of a Nao robot. It initializes the audio service, sets up processing parameters like the number of frames to process, and prepares buffers for storing audio input. The class is part of a sound processing system that can calculate RMS (Root Mean Square) power of audio signals using the ALAudioDevice service.
