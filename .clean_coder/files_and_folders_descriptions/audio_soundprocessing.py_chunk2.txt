The `startProcessing` method initializes audio input processing for the Nao robot's front microphone at 16kHz sampling rate. It opens audio inputs, subscribes to the audio device service, and runs a processing loop until `isProcessingDone` becomes true. After processing completes, it unsubscribes from the audio device service, effectively managing the audio input capture and processing lifecycle.
