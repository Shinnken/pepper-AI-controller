This code segment handles output generation for detected bottles, saving the annotated image and detection coordinates in JSON format. It writes the processed image with bounding boxes to a file named with the original image's base name, and creates a corresponding JSON file containing detection details. The code then prints the total number of detected bottles and their confidence scores, with the main function being executed when the script is run directly.
