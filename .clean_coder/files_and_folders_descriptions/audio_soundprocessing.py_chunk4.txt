The function converts raw 16-bit little-endian audio data from a string to a normalized signed float vector between -1 and 1. It processes audio samples by reconstructing 16-bit integer values from byte pairs and then scaling them to the range [-1, 1]. The conversion involves handling signed integer representation and normalizing the values by dividing by 32768. This method is crucial for preparing raw audio data for further signal processing or analysis.
