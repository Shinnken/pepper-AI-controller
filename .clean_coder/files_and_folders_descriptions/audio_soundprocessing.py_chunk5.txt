The `getBuffer()` method retrieves the last received audio buffer from the Nao robot's microphone. It returns the buffer if available and immediately clears it to prevent repeated access. If no buffer is present, it prints a message and returns None. The accompanying `__main__` section provides command-line argument parsing for specifying the robot's IP address and port, enabling flexible connection to the Nao robot's Naoqi framework.
