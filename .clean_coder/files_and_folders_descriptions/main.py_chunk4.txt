The function `moveHands` controls the NAO robot's arm movements by interpolating joint angles for specific shoulder and elbow joints. It defines two arm positions (Arm1 and Arm2) and converts degrees to radians for precise motion control. The function uses the motion service to sequentially move the robot's arms through these predefined positions at a moderate speed, creating a dynamic arm movement sequence.
