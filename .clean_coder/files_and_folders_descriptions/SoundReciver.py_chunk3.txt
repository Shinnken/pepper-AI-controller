The processRemote method is a callback function in the SoundReceiverModule that receives audio data from the NAO robot's audio device. It captures the incoming audio buffer and stores it in the class's buffer attribute for later retrieval. The method is automatically called by ALAudioDevice when new audio data is available, providing details like number of channels, samples, and timestamp. This method serves as the primary mechanism for capturing raw audio data from the robot's microphone.
