The `stop()` method unsubscribes the module from the audio device, halting audio input processing and setting the processing flag to False. The `getBuffer()` method retrieves the most recently received audio buffer, returning it and clearing the internal buffer, or returning None if no buffer is available. These methods provide control over audio device subscription and access to captured audio data, allowing clean management of audio input in the NAOqi audio processing workflow.
