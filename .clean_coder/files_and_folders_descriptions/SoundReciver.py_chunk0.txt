This code snippet imports essential Python modules for NAOqi robotics development: `qi` for interacting with NAOqi services, `time` for time-related operations, and `sys` for system-specific parameters and functions. These imports are typically used in NAO robot programming to enable communication with robot services, manage timing, and handle system-level interactions. The imports provide foundational support for creating NAOqi modules and robot applications.
