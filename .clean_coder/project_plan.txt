There are a few things we need to do with Pepper. First of all, we need to make him, when speaking, not to cut every word, but to cut every sentence on the dot, or any signs, like question marks I mean, or on the commas, like the commas. So make him like to speak all the, not just word by word, but like part of sentence to comma, or yes, by part of sentence. It's one thing. I think we need to also, when he doing like looking around, he unfortunately taking, like looking too high, and in that corner cases, I don't know how to say it, in that positions when he like turning on the 120 degrees and minus 120 degrees, he looking too high, and we need to reduce that angle of looking. Yes, that two things.
